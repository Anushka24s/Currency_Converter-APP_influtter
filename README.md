#Overview

The Currency Converter App is a sleek and user-friendly Flutter application designed to convert amounts from various currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY) to Indian Rupees (INR). Featuring a vibrant teal-themed UI, a fade-in splash screen, and a responsive design, the app provides a seamless experience for users to perform currency conversions with mock exchange rates. The app includes input validation, error handling, and a modern aesthetic with a gradient background and smooth animations.

Features





 Splash Screen: A visually appealing splash screen with a fade-in animation, displaying the app logo (built-in Icons.monetization_on) and title, which transitions to the main screen after 3 seconds.



 Currency Conversion: Convert amounts from USD, EUR, GBP, or JPY to INR using a dropdown menu to select the source currency.



 Mock Exchange Rates: Uses static exchange rates (e.g., 1 USD = 83.50 INR) for demonstration purposes, with potential for real-time API integration.



 Teal Theme: A cohesive teal gradient background, teal accents for buttons and dropdowns, and white text for high contrast.



 Input Validation: Restricts text input to valid decimal numbers (up to 2 decimal places) and displays error messages via SnackBar for invalid inputs.



 Responsive UI: Centered layout with a SingleChildScrollView for compatibility across different screen sizes.



 Reset Functionality: A reset button clears the input, result, and resets the currency to USD.



 Loading Animation: Displays a circular progress indicator during conversion for better user feedback.
